# Add insecure registry (required to use it from other hosts)
Taken from link:https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker[https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker]

Log into boot2docker using *boot2docke ssh*

Edit the profile using * sudo vi /var/lib/boot2docker/profile*

add *EXTRA_ARGS="--insecure-registry 192.168.50.4:5000"*

The restart docker *sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart*

#Vagrant
Switch to _src/main/vagrant_ and do *vagrant up*

This will start a docker registry and add a default account.

# Jenkins
Switch to _src/main/jenkins_ and do *./docker.sh*

The script will stop at some point and you will have to access your running link:http://192.168.59.103:8080/[Jenkins] to
do some manual configuration. Sadly these things can't be automated right now :(

## Add Maven
Go to link:http://192.168.59.103:8080/configure[global configuration] and select a Maven installation.

## Add ssh remote host
Go to link:http://192.168.59.103:8080/configure[global configuration] and add an SSH remote host.
